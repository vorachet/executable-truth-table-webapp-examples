# The Executable Truth Table WebApp Integration Examples

After TTABLE was released, its first version in Apr 2017, we wrote this webapp integration examples for discovering use cases of TTABLE in real world Discrete-Event (DE) System Design. Truth Table is a common component that generally used by DE System Designer in modeling conditions, states, and decisions of a computation. Our TTABLE is aimed to support software engineer works faster in designing I/O behavior and function by using TTABLE to create an executable software prototype. The TTABLE webapp integration examples demonstrate the two capabilities of TTABLE; executable TruthTable and built-in TruthTable specification generator in your Node.js prototype project.
